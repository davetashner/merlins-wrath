# Asset Credits & Provenance

Every asset committed to this repository — generated, downloaded, or made by hand — has a row here,
**added in the same commit as the asset**. The asset validator (`e37-asset-validator`) fails CI when a runtime
asset has no matching row, or a row uses a licence that isn't allowed.

Rules: `docs/art/style-bible.md` §16–17 and `docs/audio/audio-bible.md` §9. Every **final** (non-placeholder)
asset must also have an owner approval record in `assets/approvals.json` matching its file hash
(`e37-asset-approval-log`).

Typical sources: `generated:codex-gpt-image/<model>` (ChatGPT subscription via Codex CLI),
`generated:openai-images-api/<model>`, `generated:meshy-api/<model>` or `generated:tripo-api/<model>`,
`generated:suno/<model>` (owner-generated, paid tier), `generated:elevenlabs-sfx/<model>`, `kit:<name>`,
`library:<url>` (CC0). Never record API keys or account emails here.
