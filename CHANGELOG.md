# Changelog

All notable changes that players and site visitors can see are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Playtest builds will be versioned when the
first one ships; until then everything sits under Unreleased.

Engine, tooling, test and infrastructure work with no visible effect is not listed. A PR that touches
`src/{game,ui,render,audio,sim,content}/`, `src/main.ts`, `index.html` or `site/` adds a one-line note
under Unreleased, or carries the `no-changelog` label if nothing visible changes (CI's `changelog`
check enforces this).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The landing page at [thevesperbell.com](https://thevesperbell.com) with the title key art and the
  rest-lamp icon.
- An opt-in main theme player on the landing page: off by default, and nothing downloads until the
  visitor presses play.
- The public backlog at [thevesperbell.com/backlog.html](https://thevesperbell.com/backlog.html),
  rebuilt on every merge, showing each bead's status and the pull requests that close it.
