// The faction content type (mw-e12.8): who stands with whom. Goblins that fight skeletons, wolves
// that hunt sheep and guards that tolerate the player all read one table, so a faction is data: its
// default stance toward its own members, toward the player, toward every other faction, and any
// specific relations that differ. Relations are one-way (asymmetry is allowed: wolves see sheep as
// prey, sheep see wolves as predator); `mutual` also gives the other faction the mirrored stance
// unless it declares its own. The sim builds its faction table from these entries (src/sim/factions)
// and adds the runtime part: per-creature overrides and faction-wide changes caused by play.
//
// A creature with no `faction` belongs to `unaligned` (src/content/data/faction/unaligned.json).
// `player` is reserved: it names the player in the sim's table, so no faction may use it.
