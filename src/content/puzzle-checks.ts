// Load-time puzzle checks (mw-e15.1): what a puzzle file can't check alone. After every file has
// parsed, each puzzle is checked against the rest of the content: every entity it lists is a spawn of
// its scene (the level; a typo fails in CI, not in play), every capability its solutions and hints
// name is declared in the capability registry, and the facts it writes when solved are declared and
// typed (the solved fact a bool). The scene itself is a `ref`, which the loader checks. The goal
// condition is checked by src/content/condition-checks.ts (CONDITION_USAGES). Issues name the file,
// the JSON pointer and the missing id.
