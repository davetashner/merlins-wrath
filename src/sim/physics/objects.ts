// Physics objects (mw-e03.10): crates, barrels, bottles, statues and debris as dynamic rigid bodies on
// the sim-owned physics port, stepped inside the sim's fixed tick. The sim is the authority: the
// World steps the port first every tick, then `physicsObjectsSystem` copies each moving body's pose
// into its `physics.object` component (and its `spatial.placement`, so stimuli and queries find it
// where it is). The renderer only reads that pose: render sync (src/game/loop/render-sync.ts) keeps
// the previous and latest tick's transform and interpolates between them, never simulating anything.
//
// Everything comes from world properties (mw-e03.1), never from object types:
// - `weight` is the body's mass (kg; at least MIN_BODY_MASS);
// - `friction` is its friction coefficient;
// - `impactAbsorb` sets its bounciness: restitution = MAX_RESTITUTION × (1 − impactAbsorb);
// - `material` names each side of an impact for sound, noise and breaking.
// A `propertyChanged` of weight, friction or impactAbsorb (a soaked cloth gets heavier, a frozen
// floor slippery) reaches the body before the next physics step. Level colliders take part through
// `bindCollider`, which gives a static collider its entity's friction, bounciness and material.
// Pushes come through the one stimulus API: a force stimulus's `impulseApplied` is applied to the
// body, so no caller ever scripts a pair of objects.
//
// Impacts: each contact that starts with a closing speed of at least `minImpactSpeed` (1 m/s by
// default: settling and resting contacts stay quiet) emits one `physicsImpact` with its energy (J),
// impulse (N·s) and the two materials, for breakables, noise, damage and sound. Buoyancy (density) is
// e03 liquids' (mw-e03.14); carrying, pushing and levitation drive bodies through this layer later.
//
// Budget: at most `budget` bodies (300 by default) stay awake. When more are awake, the oldest
// resting bodies (awake longest, at rest, and at least `restDistance` from the focus, e.g. the
// player) are forced to sleep until the count is back within budget, and `physicsBudgetExceeded`
// reports it for the log. A forced sleeper wakes again as soon as anything touches or pushes it.
