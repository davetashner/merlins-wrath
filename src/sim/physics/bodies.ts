// Dynamic rigid bodies on the sim's physics port (mw-e03.10). Crates, barrels, bottles and debris are
// simulated by the physics engine inside the sim's fixed tick; this is the engine-agnostic surface the
// physics-object layer (objects.ts) drives, so the layer never touches Rapier types and a plain
// TypeScript reference integrator could implement it for engine-free tests.
//
// A body is one collider on one dynamic rigid body. Its handle comes from the same sequence as the
// port's static and kinematic colliders (ColliderHandle), so `remove` takes a body away too and one
// handle table covers everything in snapshots.
//
// Impacts: every step, the port reports each contact that started during it and involves at least
// one dynamic body, with the closing speed along the contact normal measured from the bodies' linear
// velocities just before the step, and the energy that closing motion carries (½ μ v², μ the reduced
// mass; a fixed or kinematic side counts as infinitely heavy). Angular velocity is not included: the
// figure is for sound, noise, damage and breaking, not for exact contact mechanics.
