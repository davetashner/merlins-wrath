// Area transitions in the sim (mw-e01.11). A scene lists the volumes that lead to other scenes (layout
// `transitions`); this system watches the player's feet against them and, on the tick the player
// walks into one from outside, emits `areaTransition`. It decides nothing about loading: the game
// answers the event by saving the old area's changes, carrying the player over and entering the target
// scene at the named spawn (src/game/transit).
//
// The event is a pure function of the player's movement, so a recorded run (mw-e01.9) raises it on the
// same tick every time. Occupancy is read afresh on the first tick, so a player who starts inside a
// volume (a loaded save made in one) has to leave and come back before it fires.
