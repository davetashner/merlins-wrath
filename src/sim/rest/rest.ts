// Resting (mw-ju8.6, the thin slice of mw-e27.13): sleep at an inn until morning. It passes the world
// day clock (./day-clock.ts) to 06:00, fully restores health, stamina and mana, and announces
// `rest.completed { kind, hours, point }`, the shape mw-e27.13 names for rest-reset persistence
// policies. Paying is the shop's job (src/sim/economy/shop.ts `buyService`); this only rests.
//
// Safety: the caller passes the autosave "unsafe" veto registry's verdict as `safety` (null = fine,
// else the reason), so no one sleeps with hostiles alerted nearby; the registry itself lives in the
// game layer (src/game/save/autosave/vetoes.ts). The autosave after a rest is requested by the game
// when it hears `rest.completed`.
//
// Out of scope until mw-e27.13: campfire and shrine rest, durations other than "until morning",
// interrupts and prorated restoration, the rest-action registry.
