// The player in the sim (mw-e02.23): the character the ActionFrames drive. Installing the player adds
// one entity at the scene's player-start spawn with a CharacterController and a PlayerLook, and two
// systems run each tick in this order: look (mouse and right stick) turns the player's view yaw, then
// the character controller moves it with the tick's ActionFrame and that yaw.
//
// With `combat` (mw-e04.8) the player also gets a stamina pool, an action timeline and a dodge, and
// four systems run between look and the controller: stamina, dodge input (a dodge press rolls in the
// held direction relative to the view yaw, or backsteps), the action timeline, and dodge motion,
// whose root-motion velocity the controller travels at while a roll or backstep runs.
//
// With `combat.melee` (mw-e04.6) the player is also a knight: the attack button starts the light
// chain (or, with a riposte, the riposte while a Parried foe is in reach: mw-e04.12), the parry
// button its parry, the block button holds its shield up, and it has a combat facing, hitboxes and a placement
// at its feet (the frame its swings are placed in). Three more systems join: block (just before the
// timeline), facing (after it: idle the knight faces where it looks — or its lock-on target — and a
// move's startup turns at 360°/s, then locks) and, after the controller, placement. While it swings
// the knight is planted and while its shield is up it walks at the shield's speed without sprinting
// (`locomotionScale`). The caller registers the hit-volume, damage and placement components, and
// adds the hit-volume system and `installMeleeStrikes` itself (they are world-wide, not the player's).
//
// With `ledges` (mw-e02.12) the controller runs the mantle and ledge-hang traversal hook over the
// scene's ledges (src/sim/climb/mantle.ts): the player mantles onto crates and sills, and with the
// ledge-hang capability grabs, hangs from and shimmies along higher ledges.
//
// With `climb` (mw-e02.13) it also runs the climbing hook (src/sim/climb/climb.ts), after the ledge
// hook: the player climbs ladders, ropes and ivy, and with the climbing capability rough walls, and
// pulls up onto the ledge at the top. With combat, climbing drains the stamina pool (the climb
// tuning's staminaPerSecond, after the controller), and at 0 the player falls. While any traversal
// mode has the player (mantle, hang, climb), no dodge, attack, block or bow draw starts: the action
// timeline's one gate, `handsBusy` (mw-e02.33).
//
// After the controller, the locomotion system (mw-e02.6) publishes what the player is doing — idle,
// walk, run, airborne, landing… — with its speeds and turn rate, and emits jump, land and footstep
// events, for animation and audio to follow. The player counts as moving while move input is held or
// a dodge's root motion carries it; its facing is the look yaw.
//
// The view yaw and pitch live in the sim (not in the camera) so a replay of ActionFrames alone
// reproduces every turn: the recorded look input (mouse counts, stick deflection) is their only source. Pitch does not move
// the player today, but aiming will (bow, spells: mw-e05.3, mw-e06.15), so it is clamped here once,
// as a rule, rather than in the camera. The orbit camera (src/game/camera, mw-e02.4) only reads them.
//
// While the player has a ViewAnchor (lock-on, mw-e02.16, src/sim/targeting) the lock-on system owns
// the view: look input does not turn it, and the controller strafes around the anchor point.
