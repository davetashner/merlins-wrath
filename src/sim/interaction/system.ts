// The Interact verb in the sim (mw-e02.5). Once per tick, for every actor with an `Interactor`:
//
// 1. Focus: the objects the actor could interact with are scored (focus.ts) from its view, those it
//    can't reach in a straight line are dropped (line of sight against the physics world, ignoring
//    the object's own colliders), and one is picked with hysteresis. The result lives on the actor's
//    `interaction.focus` component, so it is snapshotted, hashed and replayed.
// 2. Interact: the tick's `interact` button acts on the focus's primary affordance, the first one the
//    actor can use. Nothing usable (a locked door, no key, no lockpicking): nothing is dispatched. An
//    instant affordance fires `interacted` on press. A hold affordance fires once Interact has been
//    held for its duration (round(hold × hz) ticks, the press tick counting as the first); releasing
//    early, losing focus or losing the affordance cancels it and nothing fires.
//
// Owning systems (doors, containers, carrying, hiding, talking) subscribe to `interacted` and act
// through properties and the stimulus API; this system never knows what an affordance does. An owning
// system can also gate its affordances on world state the actor's kit doesn't carry (`addAffordanceGate`:
// a locked door's Unlock needs a fitting key on the keyring, mw-e17.5). The UI reads
// `interactionPrompt` (text, availability, reason, hold progress) and adds the binding glyph.
//
// Candidates are entities with a placement (`spatial.placement`) that have an `Interactable`, or a
// property that implies an affordance (affordance.ts), and are not `hidden`. Setup: register the
// world properties (registerWorldProperties) and the placement component before
// `installInteraction`, and install it after the systems that move actors (the character
// controller), so focus is computed from this tick's positions.
