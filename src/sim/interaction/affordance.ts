// Interaction affordances (mw-e02.5): what an actor can do to a world object with the one Interact
// verb. An object declares its affordances as data on an `Interactable` component (a lever: pull; a
// locked door: unlock with a key, or pick lock for a thief), and world properties add the generic
// ones (anything `liftable` can be picked up, a `container` searched, a `hideable` hidden in, a
// `pushable` pushed), so a new crate or barrel is interactable without a line of code. An
// affordance may be gated: every requirement must hold (a capability the actor has, from its class or
// skills, or an item it carries). A gated affordance the actor can't use is still offered, greyed
// with its reason ("Locked — needs Iron Key"), to hint at another route.
//
// Nothing here knows what an affordance does. The interaction system emits `interacted` and the
// owning system (doors, containers, carrying, hiding) acts on it, through properties and the stimulus
// API like every other rule, never by pairing object types.
