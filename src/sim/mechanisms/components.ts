// Mechanism components (mw-e03.18): doors, the locks they carry, and the switches (levers, buttons,
// cranks, wheels) that drive them through signal graphs. Everything is plain data on the entity, so
// doors and switches are part of snapshots, state hashes and saves like any other component. What a
// door is made of (wood burns, iron does not, a frozen door shatters) stays in its world properties;
// these components only hold what is specific to being a mechanism.
