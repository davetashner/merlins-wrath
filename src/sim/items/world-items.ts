// World items (mw-e17.7, ADR-0003): items that lie in the world as physical objects, so a dropped key
// can fall through a grate and a thrown bottle can draw a guard. A world item is an entity with an
// `item.world` component (definition, units and instance flags), the item's world properties, a
// dynamic physics body (mw-e03.10) and one affordance, "Take <name>", on the one Interact verb
// (mw-e02.5).
//
// - Pick up: the `interacted` event for a world item's pick-up adds its units to the actor's
//   inventory (mw-e17.3) with the same flags and destroys the entity, in the tick the player
//   interacts (AC-1). There is no "full" (ADR-0003): only the inventory's own refusals (the 9,999-unit
//   guard, a second unique) leave the entity where it is, with `itemPickupRefused`. Gold goes to the
//   gold counter. Ownership (stolen on a witnessed take) is e18's, applied to the flags it carries.
// - Drop: a whole stack leaves the inventory and one world item carrying its count and flags spawns
//   in front of the actor, falling from hand height (AC-2).
// - Throw: one unit leaves and spawns at shoulder height with a velocity along the actor's look,
//   lofted a little, at a speed by weight class.
// - No-drop items (quest items by default, mw-e17.2 AC-5) are refused with reason `no-drop` for both
//   (AC-4), so the slice's gallery key can never be lost.
// - Impact noise: each `physicsImpact` of a world item emits one `noiseEmitted` whose loudness comes
//   from the item's weight class (AC-3), attributed to whoever dropped or threw it. What it sounds
//   like is the cue sheets' (physicsImpact plays the material's impact set), never this module's.
//
// Everything a world item does physically comes from properties, never from its type: its body's
// mass is its `weight` (from the weight class unless its world properties say otherwise), its
// friction and bounce come from its material, it has a `temperature` (the property's 20 °C default
// unless its data says otherwise) so heat stimuli and the element field reach it (a thrown oil flask
// catches fire from a torch, mw-e17.6), and its shape is a box sized by category, the
// placeholder the renderer also draws. The drop and throw buttons act on the selected item: until the
// inventory screen (mw-e17.10) lets the player choose, that is the most recently acquired item that
// may be dropped.
