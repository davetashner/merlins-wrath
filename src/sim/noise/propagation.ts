// Noise propagation (mw-e09.3): how loud a sound is where a listener stands, and where it seems to
// come from. Constitution: sound travels like it does in a building, so closing a door or taking the
// long way round keeps a thief quiet, and a guard hears the doorway a sound came through, never the
// thief behind the wall (no omniscience).
//
//   perceived level = loudness at 1 m + distance gain over the path + every door, wall and floor gain
//   distance gain   = −20·log10(path metres), none within 1 m (inverse square: −6 dB per doubling)
//
// The search runs over the sound graph (graph.ts) from the source's room. A sound reaches a portal of
// its room in a straight line and passes it with the portal's gain (its door's state: open, ajar,
// closed; a level-supplied resolver reads it at propagation time, so door changes apply to the next
// sound at once). It passes a partition into a touching room with the wall or floor gain and carries
// on in a straight line from where it was. Each arrival is a label {room, point, accumulated loss,
// path length}; a label whose loss and length are both no better than one already settled at the
// same room and point is dropped, so the routes kept are exactly the ones some listener could hear
// loudest (both quantities only grow along a route). Labels are settled loudest first and never
// expanded below the audibility floor: the search is bounded by the floor, not by the level's size.
// Routes are compared as max(1, length) × 10^(loss / 20), which orders exactly as the level does
// (level = loudness − 20·log10 of it), so the search takes no log per step: one pow per distinct
// gain, and one log per listener for the level it reports.
//
// A listener takes the loudest route into its room. Its perceived position is the last portal that
// route came through, or the source itself when the route came straight or only through partitions
// (muffled, but from the right direction). Everything is pure and deterministic: log goes through
// simMath, distances through Math.sqrt.
