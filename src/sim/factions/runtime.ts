// Factions in the world (mw-e12.8): who belongs where, and what play has changed. Two components,
// both plain data and so part of snapshots, state hashes and saves:
//
// - `faction.member` on each creature (and the player): its faction plus per-creature overrides
//   (`toward`, keyed by faction id or `player`), e.g. the one goblin who likes the player, or
//   Brother Horn once befriended.
// - `faction.stances` on one holder entity made by `installFactions`: faction-wide changes caused
//   by play, as [from, to, stance] rows sorted by (from, to). Only stances that differ from the
//   base table are stored; setting a stance back to its base removes the row.
//
// `relation(a, b)` answers "how does a regard b?" for perception, alerts and combat: a's own
// override toward b's faction, else the faction-wide stance (changed, else base). Every change of a
// faction-wide stance emits FactionRelationChanged once. The witnessed-kill rule is the first thing
// that changes stances: killing a member in front of its kin worsens the kin's faction one step
// toward the killer's. Perception (e11) decides who witnessed; this module only applies the rule.
