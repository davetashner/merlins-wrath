// Merchant transactions (mw-e20.4): the player buys from, sells to and buys back from a merchant
// whose stock and gold are finite and remembered (docs/design/economy.md). `Shops` holds the merchant
// definitions and item definitions one game plays with; every transaction prices through `price()`
// (src/sim/economy/price.ts) and is atomic: it checks everything first, and on any failure returns a
// typed reason and changes nothing (expected failures never throw). Gold and items only move, never
// appear or vanish: a buy moves gold player -> merchant and units shelf -> pack, a sell the reverse
// with the units going to the buyback list, and the oldest buyback entry falls onto the shelf when
// the list is full (or when `clearBuyback` runs, the hook the restock bead will call).
//
// State: per merchant id, created the first time the merchant is touched from its definition (gold
// reserve and stock; a loot-table entry is rolled once with a stream derived from the world seed and
// the merchant id, so the result does not depend on the order shops are visited) and held in the
// world's merchant store (shop-state.ts), saved by the `merchants` section. Currency is `gold`.
// Events: `shop.bought`, `shop.sold`, `shop.bought-back`. Out of scope: restocking, haggling (the
// caller passes a modifier), theft and dispositions (the caller passes a band).
