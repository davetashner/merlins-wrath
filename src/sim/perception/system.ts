// The perception system (mw-e11.5): every creature with a sense profile evaluates its senses at the
// tuning's rate and raises one `perceived` event with what it picked up. It is the only place that
// reads targets' true state (their bodies, the light on them, sight lines to them); agents get only
// the percepts (percept.ts), which is the no-omniscience guarantee.
//
// Schedule. An agent is due on ticks where (tick + entity) mod period is 0, period =
// round(hz / rateHz), so agents are staggered by entity id like AI thinks. Due agents join a queue in
// ascending id order and are evaluated from its head while the tick's work budget lasts; the rest wait
// for the next tick, ahead of agents that fall due then. The budget is counted in work units, not
// milliseconds, so which agent is evaluated on which tick is replay-stable on any machine (as the nav
// request queue, mw-e11.4): one unit per agent evaluated, per sight line traced and per light sample
// read. An evaluation that has started finishes, so a tick may overrun its budget by at most one
// agent, and at least one agent is evaluated every tick that has any due. PERCEPTION_UNITS_PER_MS
// converts a time budget into units; tests/bench/perception.bench.ts holds the conversion.
//
// One evaluation, in this order:
// - Sight (the profile's `sight`): for each target (by default every character-controlled entity, the
//   player) the cone test on its chest (sight.ts); only a target in view costs sight lines, the
//   line-of-sight fraction over its sample points (mw-e09.1). Its visibility score is the e09 model
//   (mw-e09.2) with the agent's dark vision, that fraction, the distance and the light behind it (for
//   the silhouette rule). A seen target is a `seen-target` percept at its feet. Anomalies (supplied by
//   a port: mw-e09.9 defines them) are tested the same way with one sight line and the light at them,
//   as `seen-anomaly` percepts.
// - Hearing (the profile's `hearing`): every `noiseHeard` for the agent since its last evaluation, as a
//   `heard-noise` percept at the perceived position (hearing.ts). The system keeps each agent's
//   `noise.listener` in step with its hearing, so noise propagation (mw-e09.3) knows who listens.
// - Special senses: each channel of the profile with a registered handler (channels.ts).
// - Touch (every agent, whatever its profile): each target in contact with it (touch.ts), in any light
//   and from any side, as a `touched` percept (mw-e11.6). It costs no work units beyond the agent's.
//
// The agent's eye is its placement raised by the tuning's eye height × its nav agent height; its
// facing is its combat facing (+z without one).
//
// What an agent carries between evaluations (the noises it heard since its last one, when that was,
// and since when it has waited in the queue) lives in its `perception.agent` component, not in this
// system, so a save carries it and a loaded world evaluates exactly as one never saved (mw-e12.14).
// The queue is rebuilt from those components every tick: waiting agents by the tick they fell due,
// then by id.
