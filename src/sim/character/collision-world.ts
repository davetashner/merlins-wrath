// The character controller's view of physics (mw-e02.2): a thin, engine-free query interface, so the
// controller is unit-testable against an in-memory fake (fake-collision-world.ts) and the Rapier port
// (mw-e02.21) implements the same contract (collision-world.contract.ts runs against both).
//
// Conventions: world space in metres, y up. A character capsule is always vertical and is placed by
// its feet — the lowest point of the capsule — so crouching lowers the top and keeps the feet put.
// Directions passed in are unit length. Queries never see the character itself: an implementation
// that holds the character's own collider must exclude it.
