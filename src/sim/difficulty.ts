// Difficulty and assist multipliers (mw-e31.14). Combat and stealth rules need to read tunable
// multipliers from day one, long before the assists UI exists, so the sim takes a DifficultyConfig as
// an input — like the seed and tick rate, never a global. A World is created with one (every value
// defaults to the neutral 1.0), systems read it from their TickContext, it is part of the snapshot (so
// state hashes, saves and replays reproduce it), and it changes mid-game only through a
// `difficultyCommand` fed to `World.step`, which the replay recorder captures like any other command.
//
// Snapshots store only the non-neutral values (sparse overrides), so a world on default difficulty
// hashes exactly as it did before this config existed, and adding a multiplier later changes no
// existing hash.
