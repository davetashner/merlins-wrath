// The creature attack executor (mw-e12.5). Given compiled attack data (RuntimeAttack: a move plus the
// attack's own numbers, src/content/types/attack.ts), it answers "may this attacker start this attack
// now?" deterministically, runs a started attack through its windup, active and recovery ticks, fires
// the telegraph, and turns overlaps of the live hit volume into damage packets for the damage model —
// one packet per packet definition per target, so every creature hit composes through the same
// resistances, guards and modifiers as the knight's. Choosing which attack to use is AI's job (e11);
// the parry and block rules act on those packets in the damage model's guard stage (e04.6, e04.12).
//
// Timing: attack tick k (1-based) is the executor's k-th run after `startAttack` and plays the move's
// tick k − 1, so a 12/4/10 attack is active on attack ticks 13–16 and completes on tick 26. Hits:
// the move's hit volume (at its rest pose — socket tracks, e04.2, will animate it) is placed at the
// attacker's placement facing the committed aim, and tested against every living entity with a
// placement and health (its bounding sphere is the hurtbox until e04.2 adds regions). Each target is
// hit at most once per attack. Projectiles fly straight at their speed, sweep a capsule each tick and
// hit the first target along the path (level geometry does not stop them yet).
//
// I-frames (mw-e04.28): a target the `invulnerable` rule (`invulnerabilityRule`: dodge and wake-up
// i-frames, the same rule the hit-volume system asks) names on the tick it is struck gets DodgedHit
// instead of damage. A dodged melee target counts as hit for the attack, so the swing cannot catch it
// later in its window; a projectile flies on through it as if it missed (DodgedHit once per target)
// and may still hit whoever is behind. On the executor's own counter (attacks off the move system,
// below), DodgedHit names the attack as the hitbox and the bounding sphere as hurtbox `body` (torso,
// ×1).
// Run the action timeline before the executor so the rule reads this tick's move.
//
// A poise break (PoiseBroken) or death of the attacker breaks its attack off; hyperarmor is the poise
// rules' business, so a hit that did not break poise never reaches here.
//
// The move system (mw-e04.20). A melee or area attack of an attacker with an action timeline and
// hitboxes (a spawned creature in a world with knight combat) is not run by the executor's own
// counter: it is performed on the attacker's action timeline, exactly as the combat sandbox's attacker
// dummy performs its swing, so it shares every rule of the player's moves — the melee strikes open its
// hit volume on the hit-volume system (regions, i-frames, allies), its packet is tagged parryable /
// unblockable from the move, a parry in the window interrupts it and leaves the creature Parried
// (PARRIED_TICKS) with the parry's hit-stop, a shield blocks it, hit reactions interrupt and lock it,
// and hit-stop freezes it. `startAttack` turns the attacker to its aim and requests the move;
// the executor follows the timeline each tick: TelegraphStarted on each move's telegraphTick (counted
// in the move's own ticks, so hit-stop delays it), the chain's next move requested once the running
// one opens its cancel window into an attack (or reaches its last tick), the attack's extra packets
// applied after each struck target's own packet (MoveStruck; a parried swing has ended by then), and
// AttackEnded: `parried` as soon as a parry deflects it (HitParried), else once no move of it runs —
// `staggered` when a hit reaction locked it, `cancelled` when something else took the timeline,
// else `completed`. Run the
// executor after the action timeline and the hit-volume system, and install it after the melee
// strikes. Projectile, grab and special attacks, and attackers without a timeline, keep the executor's
// own counter. A projectile hits where its target's hurtboxes are (the hit-volume system's segment
// query), not at its feet, so a creature's arrow at chest height strikes a standing knight.
