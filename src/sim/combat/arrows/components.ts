// Arrow state (mw-e05.2): an arrow in flight and an arrow at rest. Plain frozen data, replaced never
// mutated, so snapshots, saves and replays carry arrows mid-flight. An arrow shares the projectile
// model of creature attacks (attacks/components.ts): a world-space position and the `dodged` list of
// targets it flew through during their i-frames (mw-e04.28), with the same meaning; what it adds is
// ballistics — a velocity that gravity and drag change every tick instead of a fixed direction and
// speed — and the arrow content id its mass, drag, penetration and damage come from.
//
// When it lands, an arrow either leaves the world (it shattered, or its airborne lifetime ran out) or
// comes to rest: its `combat.arrow` component is replaced by `combat.arrow-rest`, stuck in what it hit
// or dropped on the ground. Keeping or retrieving rested arrows is mw-e05.7's.
