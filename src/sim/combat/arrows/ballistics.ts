// Arrow ballistics maths (mw-e05.2), pure and deterministic: one fixed-step integration of an arrow's
// flight, the speed scaling of its damage, the penetration each surface hardness needs, and the
// ricochet. Only + − × ÷ and sqrt are used, so every client computes the same bits.
//
// Integration is semi-implicit (symplectic) Euler at the sim's fixed tick: the velocity takes this
// tick's acceleration first, then the position moves by the new velocity. The acceleration is gravity
// plus quadratic drag, a = g − (k / m)·|v|·v, with k the arrow's dragK (kg/m) and m its mass (kg), so
// drag bleeds speed along the flight line and the arc steepens as the arrow slows.
