// Events the arrow system emits (mw-e05.2). Render draws trails and stuck arrows from them, audio
// plays flybys and impacts (the impact follows `physicsImpact`'s conventions: the arrow as `entity`,
// what it hit as `other`, the surface material, energy, impulse, speed, normal and position, so a
// cue sheet binds it the same way), and AI hears where arrows land. Per arrow the order is ArrowFired,
// then any DodgedHit as it flies through i-frames, then arrowImpact per impact (a ricochet flies on;
// a damaging hit follows its DamageApplied events), then ArrowExpired if it never came to rest.
