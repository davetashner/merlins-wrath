// Climbable surfaces (mw-e03.22). Whether a surface can be climbed comes only from world properties,
// so every rule that changes those properties changes climbing with no special cases: ivy that burns
// away takes its climb with it (its burnt state is `destroyed`), wood that burns out becomes charred
// (climbable none), and anything frozen turns slippery. A rope arrow, a vines spell or a propped
// ladder is just an entity with the `climbable` property.
//
// The grade is the `climbable` property; what each grade asks of the actor (a capability, from its
// class or a tool) and how hard it is for nav agents is the rule table below. Queries read the
// properties live on every call, so there is nothing to invalidate: a change made on one tick is
// what the next tick's queries see (mw-e03.22 AC-3, AC-4). Climbing movement itself is mw-e02.13;
// this module only says whether an actor may attach.
