// Climbing (mw-e02.13): the traversal hook that attaches a character to anything the world marks
// climbable (ladders, ivy, rough stone and timber, ropes), moves it in surface space, hands it over
// to the ledge hook's pull-up at the top, and lets go on a jump, a crouch, the ground, a blow, an
// empty stamina bar or a surface that can no longer be held. Deterministic sim: the climber is placed
// by the sim every tick (never root motion); animation reads the `climb` locomotion state.
//
// Climbability comes only from world properties, through surfaces.ts: the grade (the `climbable`
// property) says whether the actor needs a capability (rough walls: CLIMB_ROUGH_CAPABILITY), and a
// frozen surface needs CLIMB_ICE_CAPABILITY. They are read live every tick, so every rule that
// changes them changes climbing with no special case: ivy that burns away (destroyed) or wood that
// burns out (climbable none) drops its climber at once; a surface that catches fire or freezes is
// held for slipGraceMs, then let go.
//
// Surfaces. A wall is found with a ray from the hands (handHeight above the feet) along the move
// input: the collider it hits names its piece (`ownerOfCollider`), whose properties decide. A rope
// has no collider; it is an entity with a ClimbRope line (ropes.ts), found by distance to its line.
// Authored and runtime-spawned ropes are the same data, so they climb alike.
//
// Attaching. Pressing into a surface within `reach` of the capsule attaches: by walking into it for
// the grades in `walkOn` (ladders, ropes, ivy), otherwise by a jump at it or a catch in the air, so
// bumping a stone wall never starts a climb. The hands must reach the surface and the capsule fit
// where it will hang; a character with an empty stamina bar cannot attach.
//
// Moving. Input is mapped onto the surface as the camera sees it: pushing into the surface climbs
// up, pulling away climbs down, sideways moves along it (ropes only go up and down), at the grade's
// speed. Every step keeps the hands on something the climber can hold: the ray from the hands at the
// new place must hit a holdable surface, whose normal may turn up to maxCornerAngle from the old one
// (corners are followed, sharper turns stop the climber). Anything else in the way stops it, and a
// climber moving down onto walkable ground stands on it. A rope's climber hangs off its line and
// follows its anchor, and climbs between the hands at the anchor and the hands at the rope's end.
//
// Leaving. Pushing up with a ledge of the climbed face within the hands' reach pulls up onto it: the
// ledge hook's own mantle (`LedgeTraversalHook.climbOut`), so its headroom and path checks apply.
// Jump jumps off (jumpOff), crouch lets go, an impulse knocks the climber off keeping the launch.
// Stamina: the hook reads the pool through `stamina`; at 0 the climber slips and falls. The drain
// itself is the player's climbing stamina system (staminaPerSecond, progression: mw-e10.9).
//
// The surface held is CharacterState.climb (plain data: snapshotted, hashed, replayed).
