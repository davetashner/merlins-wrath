// The player's body (mw-e02.23, mw-e02.6): the grey-box humanoid rig in the knight's colours, animated
// from the sim's locomotion. Its origin is the feet and it faces −z (look yaw 0), matching the
// transform the testbed player binds to it. It is drawn at once; when the knight model (mw-e37.21)
// has loaded it takes the boxes' place, posed by the same rig, and if the model never loads the boxes
// stay. The animation runtime does not change.
//
// Render-only (needs a GPU context to draw), so it is excluded from unit coverage and verified by the
// Playwright testbed player e2e (e2e/testbed-player.spec.ts).
