// The Forgotten miner on the animation rig (mw-e37.402): the Tripo skeleton skinned onto the grey-box
// humanoid, the same rig the knight uses, so the shipped idle, walk, attack and hit clips pose it with
// no per-model skeleton. The miner's model space (forgotten-model.ts: feet at y = 0, facing +z, any
// height) is scaled to the rig's height and turned to face −z, the rig's forward; the pick is fixed to
// the rig's `sword` bone, which hangs from the right forearm, so it swings with the arm.
//
// Render-only (needs a GPU context to draw), so it is excluded from unit coverage and verified by the
// Playwright creature e2e (e2e/creatures.spec.ts).
