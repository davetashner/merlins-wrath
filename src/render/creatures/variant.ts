// Which of the Forgotten miner's four looks a miner wears (mw-e37.402 family, see forgotten-model.ts).
// The choice is visual only, so it lives here and never touches the sim: a random salt is drawn once
// per game session and each miner hashes it with its entity id, so one game's miners can differ from
// each other, a new game looks different, and the same session always draws the same miner the same
// way. `?miner=N` pins a variant (tests, screenshots). The renderer has no Math.random (the project
// bans it), so the salt comes from the browser's crypto source.
