// Painted surfaces for the slice's layout parts and crate (mw-va0): the pillar stone, the ivy on the
// climbable ledge and the crate face. The greybox view draws parts as flat grid-shaded boxes without
// UVs; a part that wears a painting gets box UVs in world units instead, so one tile covers the same
// number of metres on every face whatever the part's size. Each material shows its fallback colour until
// the painting loads, and keeps it if the painting never does.
//
// Render-only (needs a GPU context to draw), so it is excluded from unit coverage and verified by the
// Playwright slice e2e spec.
