// The two halves of an area transition (mw-e01.11) on the game side.
//
// Leaving: `TransitionController` listens for the sim's `areaTransition` (the player walked into a
// volume) and, at the next point between sim steps, captures the carry (which captures the area's
// level deltas), records the hand-off in session storage and reloads the page into the target scene.
// A hand-off that outlasts the loading delay shows the area's name over the old page.
//
// Arriving: `Arrival` starts when the target page boots and ends when it is playable. It shows the
// same overlay if the boot outlasts the delay, and reports how long the whole transition took (from
// the crossing on the old page to the first playable frame) for the perf suite.
//
// Nothing here moves the player or touches a scene: the scene loader and the player start do that,
// from the spawn the hand-off names.
