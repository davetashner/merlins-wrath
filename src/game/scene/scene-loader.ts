// Loads scenes into the sim and the renderer together (mw-e00.21). The sim side (entities, static
// colliders) is src/sim/scene; this binds render objects to the new entities through RenderSync, so
// the renderer follows the sim like every other entity: the scene's merged static geometry hangs on
// the scene root entity and every spawn gets its own object. Unloading destroys the entities, removes
// the colliders and disposes every bound object at once, leaving nothing behind in any of the three.
//
// With `physics` (mw-e03.39), the scene's movable props (content `testprop`s with a `body`) become
// sim physics objects and its level colliders belong to stone piece entities (src/sim/scene/
// physics.ts). Their render objects follow the sim pose (`physics.object`), which RenderSync
// interpolates between the last two ticks: the renderer never simulates anything.
//
// Breakables (mw-e03.11): with physics, the scene's breakable placements and spawns get their
// content profiles (src/sim/breakables/scene.ts). A breakable piece is not part of the merged static
// geometry: it gets its own object (`objects.piece`), bound to the piece's entity, so it disappears
// from the screen the frame the sim destroys it.
//
// Renderer-agnostic: `objects` builds the scene objects (src/render/greybox for Three.js) and
// `binding` says how an object follows its entity (object3DBinding for Three.js).
