// Per-tick action sampling (mw-e02.1, mw-e02.9). The DOM adapter (dom.ts) pushes raw input events
// into an ActionSampler as they arrive; once per fixed sim tick the frame loop calls `sample()`, which
// first runs the pollers (the gamepad adapter, gamepad-dom.ts, hands over this tick's pad snapshot),
// then replays the events queued since the previous tick through the current bindings and returns one
// frozen ActionFrame. Replaying the queue in order is what keeps taps: a key that goes down and up
// between two samples reports pressed and released on the same frame (held false). No DOM here, so
// every rule is unit-tested with plain calls.
//
// Keyboard + mouse and gamepad are equal inputs merged into the one frame: pad buttons are codes
// held while down (through the pad bindings), so a button and a key on the same action OR together;
// movement takes the longer of the key vector and the left stick after its deadzone (mergeMove); the
// right stick is the frame's `lookStick`, beside the mouse's `look`.
