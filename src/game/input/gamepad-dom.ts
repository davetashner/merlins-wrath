// The Gamepad API side of input (mw-e02.9): a thin adapter that polls `navigator.getGamepads()` once
// per sim tick, from inside ActionSampler.sample(), and hands the chosen pad's snapshot to the
// sampler. The browser has no events for button or stick changes, so polling is the only way; it
// happens at the tick rate so every tick sees exactly one pad state (hot-plug included).
//
// Unlike keyboard and mouse, the pad does not need pointer lock: it works whenever the page has
// focus, so a player on the couch never has to click the canvas. Without focus the pad reads idle
// (held buttons release) but stays connected. All mapping logic is in gamepad.ts and the sampler.
