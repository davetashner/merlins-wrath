// A controllable player in a loaded scene (mw-e02.23): the glue from sampled ActionFrames to a
// body on screen. It installs the player into the sim (spawn at the scene's player start, look and
// controller systems; see src/sim/player), resolves collisions against the given CollisionWorld (the
// game passes RapierCollisionWorld over the sim's physics, mw-e02.21), binds a placeholder body to
// the player through render sync so it is interpolated like every other entity, and each drawn frame
// places the orbit camera (mw-e02.4, src/game/camera) behind the interpolated body and publishes
// small read-only readouts for the HUD and the Playwright e2e: the player's state after every sim
// tick, and the camera's after every frame it drives.
//
// With `interaction` (mw-e02.5) the player can also focus and interact with world objects: the
// sim's interaction system runs after the controller, the scene's interactable spawns get their
// affordances, and `prompt()` returns what the contextual prompt should show.
//
// With `animation` (mw-e02.6) the placeholder body is the grey-box humanoid rig, animated from the
// sim: after each sim step the player's published locomotion (CharacterLocomotion) and action
// timeline are captured (`onStep`), and each drawn frame the AnimationDriver poses the rig from them.
// Animation only reads the sim; the body's transform stays the interpolated sim position (root
// motion is never applied). A crouch lowers the rig's pelvis by CROUCH_DROP × the crouch state's
// weight, so the bent legs keep the feet on the ground.
//
// With `ledges` (mw-e02.12) the player mantles onto the scene's crates and ledges, and with the
// ledge-hang capability grabs, hangs from and shimmies along higher ones (src/sim/climb/mantle.ts);
// the rig plays the graph's mantle and hang states from the published locomotion. With `climb`
// (mw-e02.13) it climbs the scene's ladders, ropes and ivy (src/sim/climb/climb.ts) and pulls up
// onto the ledge at the top; the readout's `traversal` says which mode has it.
//
// Renderer-agnostic: the caller supplies the body object and how an object follows its entity
// (object3DBinding for Three.js). The sim steps only through the frame loop, as ever; nothing here
// mutates the sim after setup (the camera's collision queries are read-only).
//
// With `lockOn` (mw-e02.16) the player also gets lock-on (src/sim/targeting): the scene's targetable
// spawns become lock targets, and while locked the orbit camera frames the player and target together
// (LockFraming, presentation only). `lockTarget()` tells the HUD where the lock marker goes. With
// `melee` too, the knight's attacks turn toward the locked target during startup (mw-e02.31),
// located as lock-on locates it.
//
// With `bow` (mw-e05.21) and `moves`, the player also carries a bow and quiver (installPlayer's
// combat.bow): its toggle takes the bow out, fire draws and looses, and the readout's `bow` shows
// what is selected and how many arrows are left. While it draws, the orbit camera's field of view
// eases from the camera's own toward the bow's aim.fov (AimZoom), and back once the draw ends. The
// arrows themselves are the world's (startTestbedCombat installs the arrow system).
