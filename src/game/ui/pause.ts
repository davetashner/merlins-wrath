// The pause menu in the game (mw-e01.3): when it opens and closes, and what its options do. The
// screen is src/ui/pause-menu.ts; it pauses the sim (the loop runs no steps while it is open, so the
// world clock stops and a replay never sees how long the game sat paused) and captures input.
//
// Opening: Pause (Esc or P; Menu on the pad) opens it whenever the player is in play and no other
// screen is open. The keys arrive three ways, and all three end here:
// - `keydown`: a pause key on the window, after the UI's own navigation had its turn. With no screen
//   open the UI leaves Esc alone, so it pauses; with a screen open Esc is that screen's Back (screens
//   stack: Esc closes the inventory, the options or a slot list first, and the pause menu last).
// - `pausePressed`: the gameplay Pause action in sampled action frames: the pad's Menu button, a key
//   under pointer lock, and a pad disconnecting (mw-e02.9 taps Pause then).
// - `pointerUnlocked`: the browser ends pointer lock on Esc itself (and on alt-tab) without always
//   passing the key on, so losing the lock while playing pauses too.
// While the menu is open, Pause again (P, Menu) or Back (Esc, B) resumes. A Pause press recorded
// before the menu opened (the key that opened it, under pointer lock) is dropped: the first drained
// frame after opening never closes it.
//
// Save is disabled with the reason while a safety veto objects (the autosave's: a creature in Combat,
// "Can't save during combat"). Quit to Title asks first when the world has moved on since it was last
// saved or loaded (`SaveProgress`), then leaves for the title.
