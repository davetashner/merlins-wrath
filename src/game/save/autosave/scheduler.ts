// The autosave scheduler (mw-e30.5): turns "a good moment to save happened" into at most one write
// into the autosave ring, at a moment that is actually safe. Systems request autosaves (area
// transition, checkpoint volume, quest state change, rest); the scheduler adds its own timed request
// after a stretch of playtime with no autosave. A request made while any safety veto objects
// (combat, alert, mid-air, dialogue — see SafetyVetoes) waits, and however many requests pile up
// meanwhile, exactly one autosave happens once it is safe. Requests closer together than a minimum
// gap are coalesced the same way, so a player hopping back and forth over an area border does not
// spam writes.
//
// All timing is in sim ticks of playtime (world.tick), never the wall clock: a paused game does not
// run the timer, and tests step ticks. The game loop calls `update(world)` between sim steps. A
// failed write is retried once at the next safe moment; a second failure gives up on that request
// and is reported as a non-blocking warning for the HUD. Listeners (the HUD indicator) hear every
// attempt through `subscribe`.
