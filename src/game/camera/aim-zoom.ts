// The aim camera's zoom (mw-e05.21): while the player draws a bow the orbit camera's vertical field
// of view narrows from the camera's own (70°) to the bow's aim.fov (55° for the shortbow), and widens
// back once the draw ends. Presentation only: the sim says whether the player draws (isDrawing); this
// eases the lens toward the matching field of view each drawn frame.
//
// The ease is exponential with the bow's aim.time as its time constant: each frame closes
// 1 − e^(−dt / time) of the gap, so after `time` seconds the lens has come about two thirds (63%) of
// the way, fast at first and settling without overshoot, the same at any frame rate. Within
// SETTLE_DEGREES of its goal it snaps there, so a settled lens stops changing (and the camera's
// projection is not rebuilt every frame).
