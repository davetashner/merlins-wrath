// The combat HUD's game glue (mw-e04.10): what the player's health and stamina bars show, and which
// sim events make them react. The UI widget (src/ui/combat-hud.ts) holds no rules and reads no sim
// state; this file reads the sim once per drawn frame and turns its events into HUD feedback:
//
// - ActionRejected{reason:"stamina"} on the player → the stamina bar flashes.
// - DamageApplied on the player → an arc towards where the hit came from, when that is off screen.
//   "Where it came from" is the instigator's position at the hit (the swinging dummy, the archer),
//   else the delivering entity's, else the reverse of the packet's travel direction. The bearing is
//   taken against the camera's forward on the frame the HUD shows it, so it reads relative to the
//   view the player has, and only hits outside the horizontal field of view get an arc.
//
// Events are queued as the sim emits them and handed to the widget on the next drawn frame, with
// that frame's time, so the bars and the feedback always describe the same sim state.
