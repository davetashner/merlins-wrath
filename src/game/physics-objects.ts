// Physics objects in the game (mw-e03.39): sets the game world up for the sim's physics-object
// layer (mw-e03.10) and turns its budget warnings into log lines. The sim owns every body; the game
// only installs the layer, says where the player is (bodies near the player are never forced to
// sleep) and reports `physicsBudgetExceeded`. Scene props become physics objects in the scene loader
// (src/game/scene/scene-loader.ts), which also binds their render objects to the sim pose.
//
// The game world also accepts stimuli (mw-e04.34): the stimulus queue and its system, right after
// the physics-object system, so a force stimulus pushes props and characters (src/game/combat wires
// characters) before the player's controller steps.
