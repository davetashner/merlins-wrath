// Mechanisms in the game (mw-e03.18): the glue between the sim's doors, locks and switches
// (src/sim/mechanisms), content's door profiles, locks and signal graphs, and the renderer.
//
// - `startMechanisms` sets a loaded scene's mechanisms going: it installs signals (if nothing has
//   yet) and mechanisms, with door leaves colliding in the physics port, closed doors occluding the
//   light field, and keys found on the actor's keyring, then makes the scene's doors and switches
//   and wires its signal graphs. Call it after the player is set up, so doors and switches get their
//   prompts and run after the interaction system.
// - `readDoorLeaf` is how a door's leaf object follows the sim: the leaf's pose at its openness,
//   which RenderSync interpolates between ticks.
// - `MechanismWatch` publishes what the doors and switches are doing, for the e2e
//   (#app[data-mechanisms]).
//
// No mechanisms, no cost: the game only starts them in scenes that have some (`hasMechanisms`).
